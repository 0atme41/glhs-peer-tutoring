# GLHS Peer Tutoring App
This app is a pared-back version of part of a system of interacting apps GLHS uses for their internal internship program, CSGator. The peer tutoring app allows students to connect with tutors for subjects they are struggling in. Students sign up to be either a tutor or a student, and are automatically paired with a matching teacher. This project uses Flask and SQLite for web and database functionality.
