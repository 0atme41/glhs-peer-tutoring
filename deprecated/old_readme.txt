RULE ONE: Have permission before adding ANYTHING to the website

RULE TWO: Explanation boxes or statements have to be GOOD. I'm not just talking typos and capitalization: If you can't write, don't write!! Get someone else to who can.

RULE THREE: Follow the basic format of the website! Use the same fonts, colors, and general style that makes sense. It's ok to break style but only when it looks better than keeping the original file.

RULE FOUR: ALL images must be approved before being added to the website.

RULE FIVE: Don't delete ANYTHING unless you know exactly what it's for.

More rules will be added as time goes on.

///
YOU MIGHT BE WONDERING: Who do I have to ask to 'approve' things?
SIMPLE ANSWER: Sam Fishburn or Nate Case. If Mr Fox tells you to add something, email BOTH Sam and Nate to let us know what you're changing. Contact us at sjfishburn@students.wcpss.net and nrcase@students.wcpss.net.
